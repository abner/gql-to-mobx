# gql-to-mobx [WIP]
#### A library for converting GraphQL-types to Mobx State Tree models. 

### What's the goal?

Converting GraphQL-types (with subtypes etc.) to Mobx State Tree-models to avoid multiple type definitions
in a project using GraphQL and MST.

### Want to help build it?

This project is mostly started as a personal project because it's something I feel would be really awesome to have.
I'll be working on it whenever I have some spare time, so if anyone wants to join me in creating in then hit me up. 
Anyone is welcome!

- [ ] Refactoring
- [ ] Creating MobX-State-Tree specific GQL types (enum, references, identifier etc.)
- [ ] TypeScript/FlowType type-checking
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] ?
